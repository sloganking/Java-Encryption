# Java-Encryption
[Self teaching] Old project from 2015. Encryption process inspired by the [Numberphile video on the enigma machine.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2_Q9FoD-oQ)

This project contains older code that is no longer representative of my coding abilities / standards but I wanted to share the project anyways.

## Warning

The encryption algorithm contained in this project was made for educational purposes and should not be used in any production environment.
