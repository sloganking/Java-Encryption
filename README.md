# Java-Encryption
[Self teaching] Old project from 2015. Encryption process inspired by the [Numberphile video on the enigma machine.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2_Q9FoD-oQ)

This project contains older code that is no longer representative of my coding quality / standards but I wanted to share the project anyways.

## Warning

The encryption algorithm contained in this project was made for educational purposes and should not be used in any production environment.


## Details

This project implements a [symmetric-key encryption algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm) via [substitutionâ€“permutation network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution%E2%80%93permutation_network)
